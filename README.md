# WaveRider -- A Wave Feature Recognition Tool

This is a series of scripts that produces a neural network with the intent of
using it detect bifurcations and other topological defects in materials examined
with a scanning tunneling microscope (STM).

### Introduction

When a surface is being examined by an STM, there are often a lot of external
factors that can add noise to the image. There are also a lot of impurities in
the data, such as structures that resemble radial gaussians or spherical caps.
There are instances where the data is so convoluted by these that it makes it
very difficult to analyze
